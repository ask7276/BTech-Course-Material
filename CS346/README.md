# Software-Engineering

### This is course work done for CS346: Software Engineering Lab, Jan-Apr 2021, IIT Guwahati.

Project assigned for the lab was deal finder application. The project description is as follow:

Online shopping makes the shopping process easy. But it often happens that you buy something from an eCommerce site and later you realize it could
have been much cheaper in another eCommerce site. Sometimes these eCommerce platforms such as Flipkart, amazon show different prices for the same product. 
To not be a fool next time, you can do extensive search on
your product prices and also search for valid coupon codes. Doing this can save lots of money in the end. In this project, you have to develop a software solution that can help a shopper find the best deals
while buying a product from the eCommerce website.

In this course we used User-Centric Design Approach and performed tasks at various stages of Development Cycle.
